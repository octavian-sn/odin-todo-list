# odin-todo-list
Project: Todo List from TheOdinProject curriculum

This project has been very challenging but also highly educational, because, as it turned out, I didn't quite understood modules before diving into this project, and looking back at it now, I think it would have been quite impossible to achieve such a feat with spaghetti code.

Throughout this project I have used everything I learned so far in the curriculum and learned even more doing so. I found myself stuck a few times, first being when I realized that I didn't know how to actually organize all my code, due to not understanding modules correctly, which sort of linked with my second issue, passing arguments to functions from event capturing and DOM traversing. Due to not spending enough time with this concept, this simple fact eluded me at the beginning, which really confused me, since I was aware that it was going to be quite a large project and that I would need to separate the display from the logic.

I also had some trouble figuring out how to reattach methods back to my project objects when retrieving them from local storage. I figured I could either use a prototype or recreate them using the same constructor, I decided on the latter.  

I got to practice my usage of OOP, HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS, WebPack, NPM and Photoshopping .
